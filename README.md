# Monthly Test May

## Question 2 (75 marks)

Like in every assignment you will get the desktop design image, a mobile
design image and all you have to do is recreate as a living breathable
website. You will be so proud that you did this and hey you can even add it
in your resume, the designs are that professional, so give your best shot :)
The assets are available inside MayMonthlyTestAssets.zip. As usual all the
instructions are present inside the folder itself. For responsiveness, you can
simply import the bootstrap grid file alone. This is the link to paste. SCSS is
must, to speed up the development process. BEM is optional, but using it
will literally supercharge your workflow.
